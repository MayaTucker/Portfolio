      About Maya
    </h3>
   
  <p>While working in the office setting I have become very acquainted with people from different walks of life. Though I like managing accounts, I have always had an interest in working on websites for "mom and pop businesses". </p>
 
  <p>Being a student at Thinkful has given me the opportunity to start a new chapter developing amzaing webpages and I couldn't be more excited.</p>

  <p>If you have room on your team for a bubbly new developer please don't hesitate to reach out to me! I am happy to get to expand my knowlege of software.</p>
